After having some fun writing a raycasting engine in Javascript, I thought it would be fun to create a terribly impractical first person Tetris game.

Use WASD to move.  Q and E sidestep.  "Shoot" a piece with the left and right arrows to move it, up to rotate, and down to drop.

Don't get smashed.
