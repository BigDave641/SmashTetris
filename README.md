After having some fun writing a raycasting engine in Javascript, I thought it would be fun to create a terribly impractical first person Tetris game.

**How to play:**

    Click on the game to begin.

    Mouse controls: Use WASD to walk.  "Shoot" a piece with left/right click to pull/push it, control-click to rotate, and space to drop.
        
    Press escape to activate keyboard controls: Use WASD to walk.  Q and E sidestep.  "Shoot" a piece with the left and right arrows to move it, up to rotate, and down to drop.

    Don't get smashed.
